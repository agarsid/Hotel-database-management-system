# Hotel-database-management
## Calculation of total charges of the customer residing in the hotel
In the hotel industry,there is a constant need for evaluation of the total charges that a customer needs to pay for his stay and the use of hotel facilities during the period of his residence. Hence,we target to build a database management system which allows the staff to  check room availability, authenticity of the individual and also keeps a track of the charges depending upon the individual's type of room, meal plan and house keeping services.
**Assumptions:** (a) The hotel has variable number of rooms and the admin has to enter the number of rooms available. (b) Only 1 room can only be allotted to 1 guest. 
We aim to optimize the system by implementing the following features (1)Recording their check-in and check-out dates (2)Check Room Availability, (3) Authenticizing an individual by using his HKID or passport number, (4) Recording their Name, Address and Phone Numbers, (5) Allotting a room according to their preferred choice of room, (6) Meal Plan Tariffs and (7) House Keeping Services (8) Delete record after Check-out (9) Update Commodity information; (10) alert the receptionist when it's check-out date of a guest.
