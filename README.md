# Hotel-database-management System
## Calculation of total charges of the customer residing in the hotel
    In the hotel industry, there is a constant need for evaluating the total charges that a customer
    needs to pay for his stay and the use of hotel facilities during this period. Hence, we target to 
    build a database management system which allows the staff to check room availability, authenticity
    of the individual and also keep a track of the charges depending upon the individual's type of room,
    meal plan and house keeping services.
## Assumptions:
1. The system can be implemented for a maximum of 1000 rooms and the admin has to enter the number of rooms of the hotel. 
2. 1 room can be allotted to only 1 guest/family.
3. The meal plan is on a per head basis i.e. there is a fixed charge for each meal. 

### We aim to optimize the system by implementing the following features
1. Recording the guests' check-in and check-out dates.
2. Check Room Availability.
3. Authenticizing an individual by using his HKID or Passport number.
4. Recording their Name, Address and Phone Numbers.
5. Allotting a room according to the guests' preferred choice.
6. Meal Plan Tariffs.
7. House Keeping Services.
8. Delete record after Check-out.
9. Update Room Availability log.
10. Alert the receptionist when it's check-out date of a guest.
